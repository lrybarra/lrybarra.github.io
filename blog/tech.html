<!-- 
- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

	It was great to collaborate on ideas. I was the driver during the creation of the wireframe and as I drove I made sure to communicate with my peer partner. Using my previous experience in designing blogs, I put together a simple looking blog template and took into account my peer's input. 

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	Yes, it was like sketching out an idea without diving straight into the code, giving us a design to work from. This was extremely helpful and not something I had previously done. I

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

	A layout that was easy on the eyes, not too complex, and somewhat simple to code to (since we had time constraints)

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

	I did not learn any new semantic elements as I have had some experience with HTML
