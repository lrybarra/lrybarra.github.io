<h2>Ruby classes vs. JavaScript constructor functions</h2>
<br>
<p>
Recently, I developed a command-line text-based basketball simulator game. I actually ported the code from an older software program I wrote as a teenager to JavaScript. The older program was written in a non-Object Oriented Language and thus I needed to create classes in JavaScript to get all the benefits. <br><br>
Because I wanted many teams to be created in the game, I used a JavaScript constructor to easily initialize a team and it's Print Roster function.<br>
After I finished the first version of this game, I decided to port it over to Ruby, which utilizes classes as everything is an object. I needed to remember the proper syntax for class variables and added an <code>@</code> to each of them. In JavaScript, the same thing is accomplished by using the <code>this</code> keyword.<br><br>
In Ruby, you create an initialize method inside the class but in JavaScript all attributes and functions are contained within the constructor function. I believe that Ruby allows for easier expansion of classes in this way.<br><br>
You can see my code below for a great comparison of the two.<br>Have a nice day!<br><br>
<code>
# Ruby<br><br>

class Team<br>
<br>
  def initialize(name, g, f, bck)<br>
	@name = name<br>
	@g = g<br>
	@f = f <br>
	@bck = bck<br>
	@games = 0<br>
	#@color = color<br>
	@w = 0<br>
	@l = 0<br>
	@pts = 0<br>
	@o_pts = 0<br>
  end<br>
<br>
  def printRoster()<br>
    # print roster<br>
  end<br>
end<br>
</code>
<code>
/* JavaScript */
function team(name, g, f, bck, color){<br>
	this.name = name; <br>
	this.g = g; <br>
	this.f = f; <br>
	this.bck = bck; <br>
	this.games = 0;<br>
	this.color = color;<br>
	this.w = 0;<br>
	this.l = 0;<br>
	this.pts = 0;<br>
	this.o_pts = 0;<br>
	this.printRoster = function(){<br>
		console.log(this.color,"ROSTER:", this.g.j_no, this.g.name, "&&", this.f.j_no, this.f.name, "&&", this.bck.j_no, this.bck.name, "\n");<br>
	};<br>
};<br>
</code>

<!-- 
- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

	It was great to collaborate on ideas. I was the driver during the creation of the wireframe and as I drove I made sure to communicate with my peer partner. Using my previous experience in designing blogs, I put together a simple looking blog template and took into account my peer's input. 

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	Yes, it was like sketching out an idea without diving straight into the code, giving us a design to work from. This was extremely helpful and not something I had previously done. I

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

	A layout that was easy on the eyes, not too complex, and somewhat simple to code to (since we had time constraints)

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

	I did not learn any new semantic elements as I have had some experience with HTML
