      <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>

      <div>
        <p>The most glaring difference between classes and ids is that classes can be used across multiple elements, while ids can only be used on one element. Sort of like how you can have many people with the name Albert, but only one Albert can have the social security number 111-11-1111.</p>
        <p>CSS makes no distinction between the two, so you are free to utilize either. However, it is best practice to use classes for CSS styling and ids for Javascript.</p>
        <p>Classes are identified with a "." in CSS while ids are identified with a "#".</p>
        <p>Elements can have a class and an id, just make sure that you are not repeating the id on any other element.</p>
        <p>Each of these has special advantages when used correctly. Plus, they look really cool!</p>
