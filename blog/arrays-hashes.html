<h2>Arrays & Hashes</h2>
<br>
<p>
Arrays and hashes are two very important data structures in computer programming. A data structure is a fancy way of saying how a collection of data is arranged. There are many similarities between these two items, however there are also quite a few differences.<br><br>

You can think of an array like a row of lockers, and in each locker is a piece of data. This data could be a number, a letter, a String (collection of letters), or even another array (Imagine if you opened one of the lockers and inside was another set of lockers).<br><br>

A hash can be visualized like a dictionary, with keys and values. In a dictionary, the key is the word and the value is the pronunciation, definition, and sometimes a picture. <br><br>

In the Ruby programming language, both can be created easily and in a variety of ways. We will highlight two below:<br><br>

<code>
	#Ruby<br>
	my_array = [1, 2, 3]<br>

	my_hash = Hash.new<br>
</code><br><br>

They are similar in that they can hold a seemingly infinite amount of data. An array can be thought of as hash where the key values are sequential integers. You can access data in these two structures in the following ways:<br><br>

<code>
	#Ruby<br>

	my_array[0] = 2<br>

	my_hash["key"] = "value"<br>
</code><br><br>

This is just a quick overview of Arrays and Hashes, we encourage you to learn more as your programming career progresses!

<!-- 
- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

	It was great to collaborate on ideas. I was the driver during the creation of the wireframe and as I drove I made sure to communicate with my peer partner. Using my previous experience in designing blogs, I put together a simple looking blog template and took into account my peer's input. 

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	Yes, it was like sketching out an idea without diving straight into the code, giving us a design to work from. This was extremely helpful and not something I had previously done. I

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

	A layout that was easy on the eyes, not too complex, and somewhat simple to code to (since we had time constraints)

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

	I did not learn any new semantic elements as I have had some experience with HTML
