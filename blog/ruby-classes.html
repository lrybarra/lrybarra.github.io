<h2>Ruby Classes</h2>
<br>
<p>

In order to visualize a Ruby class we will model a component stereo system<br>

The Stereo class will have attributes make, model, maximum wattage output, and power (on / off).<br>

Our first method, toggle_power will switch the power on and off.<br>

We have methods to increase and decrease volume.<br>

<code><br>
class Stereo<br><br>

  attr_accessor :make, :model, :max_watts, :power

  def initialize(make, model, wattage, power=false)<br>
    @make = make<br>
    @model = model<br>
    @max_watts = wattage<br>
    @power = false<br><br>

    @volume = 0<br>
  end<br><br>

  def toggle_power<br>
    @power == true ? @power = false : @power = true<br>
  end<br><br>

  def increase_volume<br>
    @volume += 1<br>
  end<br><br>

  def decrease_volume<br>
    @volume -= 1<br>
  end<br><br>

end<br>
</code>

<!-- 
- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

	It was great to collaborate on ideas. I was the driver during the creation of the wireframe and as I drove I made sure to communicate with my peer partner. Using my previous experience in designing blogs, I put together a simple looking blog template and took into account my peer's input. 

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	Yes, it was like sketching out an idea without diving straight into the code, giving us a design to work from. This was extremely helpful and not something I had previously done. I

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

	A layout that was easy on the eyes, not too complex, and somewhat simple to code to (since we had time constraints)

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

	I did not learn any new semantic elements as I have had some experience with HTML
