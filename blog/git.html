  <h2>An introduction to version control</h2>
  <h4>Jan 4th 2016</h4>

      What are the benefits of version control?
      
      Version control allow software developers to have the ability to have 
      a history of the changes made to a software project. This is beneficical 
      in many ways, including the freedom to work on new features without 
      having to worry about breaking the master copy of the software.
      
      The master copy, or 'master branch' is the latest working copy of the
      software. When working with a team, several developers can be working 
      at the same time by using version control, and they can keep track 
      of who makes what. 
    </p>
    <p>
        How does git help you keep track of changes? 
        
        Git helps you create new branches of your project, and there is a 
        specific process one must go through in order to merge the new branch
        back into the master branch.
        
        With git, you create a copy of the project and then make changes to 
        it. When you make changes to the project, it is best practice to 
        summarize the details of the changes. This way, new developers can be
        caught up to speed when joining a project.
        
        You can check the git log to see all the changes that have been made
        in the project's history.

    <p>
        Why use GitHub to store your code?
        
        Because GitHub is a social site used by developers all around the world,
        and is an implementation of git on the web. You can work on a software 
        project from different machines, and developers who may not be in your
        network can do the same. 
        
        GitHub features an easy to use interface and can be customized with a 
        profile, allowing developers to showcase their own uniqueness.
